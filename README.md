# Racing Post Horse Race Scraper
This is a simple python scraper that scrapes horse races from RacingPost.com and parses the data into appropriate objects, cleans them and persists them to database for further processing. 

*Note that this project is a POC*

# Usage
A batch script is employed to download web pages locally using regex that builds expected paths. 

2 seperate scrapers are declared to parse horse/jockey data and race data separately.
